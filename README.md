# Zero-Factor Authentication 🤖🔐

Welcome to the **Zero-Factor Authentication** project! 

## 🚀 What is this?
A fun, modern, and (almost) magical authentication UI that asks for a code you never asked for! 

> "We have just sent you the code 111111 to your phone number xxx-xxx-3257. Please enter the code below."

## ✨ Features
- Super simple OTP input (just 6 boxes, you can't miss it!)
- Stylish and responsive design 💅
- Success animation with a big fat checkmark ✔️
- Resend option (because who doesn't love clicking resend?)
- Absolutely zero factors required (except your sense of humor)

## 🖼️ Preview

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Pretend you received the code (we won't tell anyone)
4. Enter `111111` and bask in your success

## 📁 Files
- `index.html` – The main HTML file
- `style.css` – All the beautiful styles
- `script.js` – The brains (and jokes) behind the operation

## 🤔 Why Zero-Factor?
Because sometimes, less is more. And sometimes, more is just more work.
